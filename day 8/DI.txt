1. Dependency Injection (IOC - inversion of control)
2. Data Annotation
3. Partial Pages

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	As a developer we create a lots of object, we do not write 
		Destructor
		Dispose 
		Clean up - unreference an object from an memory
	
		developers feel GC will come and do it for us

	-------------
		We also need to share object between
			with same user with multiple request
			with multiple users

	------------------------------------------------
		Instead now, Framework will create an object, and Inject it whereever needed
			will take care of shareing the object, with users, request and respose etc..
			will take care of destroying the object

	-----------------------------------------------------------------
		Part 2 : Config - When should framework destroy the object
			1. PerCall - Transcient - create new object for every new request and destroy 
						the object after response
			2. PerSession - Scoped - create new object for every user, destroy when session 
						gets closed
			3. Global - SingleTon - create a new object, share the same object with every user
						destroy when u stop the server
